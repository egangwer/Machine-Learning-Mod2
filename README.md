# Machine-Learning-Mod2
This repository includes coursework and the final project for MSBR 70260: Machine Learning. 

The course focused on end-to-end machine learning workflows: framing problems, preparing data, building models, and communicating insights. We explored both supervised and unsupervised methods using R.

üîç Topics Covered

Linear & Logistic Regression
Decision Trees & Ensemble Models (Random Forest, Boosting)
Model Evaluation & Tuning
Hierarchical & K-Means Clustering
Data Visualization & Cleaning
Model Interpretation & Insight Communication


üíº Final Project: Artwork Valuation

The capstone project applied regression and ensemble methods to predict artwork values based on features such as artist, medium, size, and date. The dataset was compiled from public sources and cleaned for modeling. Evaluation metrics included RMSE and cross-validation, with variable importance used to interpret results.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools

R, RStudio
dplyr, ggplot2, caret, rpart, randomForest
RMarkdown for analysis and reporting
